            <h1>NyanHelsing Welcomes You! üåà</h1>

            <p>
                Hello, amazing human (or cat, we don't discriminate)! üê±üí´ You've just taken your first step into a world where your needs for work meet our platform's magic. Before we embark on this journey together, let's chat about the map that'll guide us ‚Äì our Terms of Service (ToS). We‚Äôve ditched the legalese to make everything as clear and as friendly as possible. By joining us, you're agreeing to these terms, so grab a cup of tea, and let‚Äôs go through them together, shall we?
            </p>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Eligibility</strong>: Open to everyone 18 years and older. We're all about embracing diversity and fostering a space where everyone feels welcome and valued.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Account</strong>: Creating your account? Just be your authentic self and keep your info fresh. Your password is your secret; guard it with your life (or at least with some serious care).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Voice Matters</strong>: Got a request or a need? Shoot! Our platform thrives on your needs and ideas. While we can't promise the moon, when an intake is submitted, we aim to reach the stars in getting you matched with the right opportunities.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Culture of Respect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Creativity is Sacred</strong>: We bow down to the altar of creativity. Everything you see here is either ours or used with love and permission. Let‚Äôs respect and celebrate the work of all creators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be the Good</strong>: Our platform is a no-drama zone. It‚Äôs all about support, growth, and respect. Anything less, and we might need to part ways (but let‚Äôs hope it never comes to that).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>You Hold the Keys</strong>: Your account is your realm. If someone else storms the castle because you left the drawbridge down (aka shared your password), we can't ride in on our white horses to save the day.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Growth Through Feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Let's Talk</strong>: Encountered a hiccup? Have ideas on how we can be better? Send an intake request! We‚Äôre all ears and here to evolve through your feedback.
                </li>
            </ul>
