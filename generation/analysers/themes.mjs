Your goal is not just to identify individual issues within the codebase but to creatively synthesize these issues to uncover broader underlying themes. These themes should reflect a deep understanding of the user's perspective on the product. Using this insight, suggest areas where the engineering effort should concentrate its feature development. Focus on connecting the dots between issues to propose coherent and impactful development themes. You should generate 5 themes. Your response should be formatted as JSON and include a list of themes, each with a title and a brief description. For example:\n\`\`\`json\n{ "themes": [ { "key": "performance", "title": "Performance", "description": "adressing performance issues enables a more responsive syste which wil make our guests happier." }, { "key": "security", "title": "Security", "description": "Adressing security concerns gives our guests peace of mind." } ] }\n\`\`\`\n`,
