                We do not share your personal information with third parties except

            </h3>
            

            <p>We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information. Part of this commitment involves sharing your data with trusted third-party service providers who perform essential functions on our behalf:</p>

            <h4>3.1.1 Deno Deploy</h4>
            <p>
                To ensure our services are efficient and responsive, we host our
                server infrastructure on Deno Deploy, a leading edge computing
                platform. This setup allows us to process and manage your data
                with high performance and reliability. Here's what this means
                for your personal information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-Managed Processing:</strong> While our server is
                    hosted by Deno Deploy, the processing of your personal data —
                    from intake requests to account changes — is conducted by our
                    own applications. Deno Deploy provides the computing
                    environment, but the management and processing of data are
                    performed under our direct control and oversight of our
                    applications.

            </ul>

            <h4>3.1.2 Supabase</h4>
            <p>
                We utilize Supabase for our database needs, which involves
                storing personal data such as email addresses, TikTok
                usernames,and other information you provide. Supabase is
                committed to data security and privacy, ensuring your
                information is handled with care and in accordance with
                applicable laws and regulations.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.3 Sentry</h4>
            <p>
                To enhance the reliability and performance of our services,
                we utilize Sentry, an error tracking service that helps us
                identify and fix issues in real-time. Sentry is designed to
                improve the user experience by ensuring our application runs
                smoothly and efficiently.

            <h5>3.1.3.a Data Handling with Sentry</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intentional Data Minimization:</strong> We take
                    proactive steps to configure Sentry in a way that minimizes
                    the capture of personal information. Our goal is to capture
                    only the technical details necessary to diagnose and resolve
                    errors, without collecting or storing personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Potential for Inadvertent Data Capture:</strong> While
                    our intention is to avoid personal data capture in error logs,
                    there are scenarios where personal information might be
                    included within an error message or stack trace. This can
                    happen inadvertently due to the nature of the errors being
                    logged.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Filtering and Masking:</strong> We implement 
                    data filtering and masking techniques to prevent personal
                    information from being captured by Sentry. This includes
                    configuring Sentry's settings to exclude sensitive data
                    fields and using data scrubbing features to remove any
                    inadvertently captured personal information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Review and Compliance:</strong> We regularly review
                    the data captured by Sentry to ensure compliance with our
                    privacy standards and data protection laws. If personal
                    information is identified in an error log, we take immediate
                    steps to remove it and adjust our data capture mechanisms to
                    prevent future occurrences.
