# We Don't Need Facebook

Creating a personal webpage using GitHub Pages is a great idea for anyone interested in establishing an online presence without delving deeply into web development or incurring hosting costs. GitHub Pages offers a straightforward way to host a static website for free, using Markdown for content creation, which is easy to learn even for non-technical users.

- GitHub Pages is a _free_ hosting service for static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
- No prior coding knowledge is required, just basic computer skills.
- This activity is free, easy to update, customizable, and perfect for personal projects, portfolios, or simple blogs.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account.
- Basic understanding of Markdown. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/)

## Step 1: Create a New Repository
- Navigate to GitHub and log in.
- Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
- Name your repository `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
- Leave it public and initialize with a README.

## Step 2: Activate GitHub Pages
- Go to your repository settings.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Select the main branch as the source.
- Click "Save," and GitHub will provide a link to your website.

## Step 3: Add Your Content Using Markdown
- Explain the basics of Markdown: headers, links, images, bullet points, etc.
- Show how to edit the README.md file or add new .md files for more pages.
- Commit changes and explain how these changes automatically update the website.

## Step 4: Customize Your Website

## Step 5: Publishing Your Site

## Additional Resources
- Provide links to Markdown resources.
- Suggest resources for learning more about HTML/CSS for further customization.
- Offer examples of GitHub Pages websites for inspiration.

## Conclusion

Building a personal website is a no-cost activity that can be completed in a few hours. It's a great way to showcase your work, share your thoughts, and learn the basics of web development. Not only does it provide a platform for real self-expression that is difficult to censor or silence, but it also serves as a valuable addition to your portfolio of skills.

GitHub and GitLab are overall quite supportive spaces to learn and grow, and the community is generally very helpful. If you want to contribute to more projects than just your own, it's super easy to "fork" existing projects and make changes to them, and them propose the change to the original authors through a "Pull Request" (So named becuase they'll "pull" the proposed changes into the codebase.

If you're interested in learning more about web development, consider joining a community like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), where you can learn to code for free and build projects that help nonprofits.
