# Brevity Wins

In the coding realm, brevity wins. Short files turn bug hunts from marathons to sprints. Two rules reign: Modularize, Simplify.

Modularize: Slice your code kingdom into manageable lands. Smaller realms are easier to patrol, easier to know.

Simplify: Clarity is your sword. Cut through complexity. Make your code a clear path, not a maze.

This creed is not just bug warfare. It's respectâ€”a nod to future travelers of your code. Make their journey smoother, their understanding quicker.

Thus, in code's vast kingdom, let brevity light the way. Less becomes more: more clear, more kind. In this concise crafting, discover the elegance of simplicity, the unity of coders.
